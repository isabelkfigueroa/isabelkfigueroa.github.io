# Necessity of Property Rights

According to Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, capitalism fails in many developing and former communist countries as a result of unsatisfactory formal property systems. Mr. De Soto’s book, _The Mystery of Capital_ (2000), explains that if we want capitalism to work around the world, we must officially document assets such as homes and businesses. Legal reform must make entrance into the formal economy feasible for the majority of the world’s population.

# Benefits for the Individual

Contrary to popular belief, Mr. De Soto argues, the poor do have assets. Many governments simply do not have the necessary frameworks in place for people to easily obtain, and keep, official registration of their assets. Property without legal representation, such as a house without a title, or a business without a license or patent rights, becomes dead capital incapable of producing additional value.

Capitalism functions properly in places where people can legally define their assets. A clear, legal status brings an asset to life beyond the physical world, and allows people to expand their economic interactions from solely with people they know, to a wider market. For example, with officially recognized collateral, people can obtain loans from banks.

# Benefits for the Community

Property rights don’t just help the individuals that receive them. Property owners invest in their assets, and create additional business for banks, insurance firms, builders, etc. People with vested interests in their communities are more likely to respect the property of their neighbors, and want to keep the peace.

Formalization provides suppliers of public utilities with reliable information regarding accountable consumers. When government organizations have property-based information to rely on, they are able to provide more effective services.

# Lessons from the Past

In Europe in the late 1500s, migrants began moving from the countryside to the cities. Authorities who disapproved of the growing population in the cities enacted laws that restricted the expansion and diversification of formal businesses, which restricted migrants’ ability to find jobs in the legal sector. Lawmakers and elites hoped that the migrants would return to the countryside. Instead, ambitious entrepreneurs operated illegally, often on the outskirts of the cities. Disputes between members of the formal and informal economy persisted. Finally in the 1800s, laws began to change in favor of the masses.

Today, developing and former communist country governments are obliged to provide property rights to extralegal citizens just as many Northern and Western European countries were forced to do. Today’s developing and former communist countries, however, face the additional challenge of incorporating far larger populations.

Hernando de Soto’s [Institute for Liberty and Democracy][1]{:target="_blank"} seeks property rights and formal economy inclusion for people all over the world.
