British development economist Paul Collier draws attention to the needs of the
poorest billion people on earth in his 2007 book, _The Bottom Billion: Why the
Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It_. Professor Collier
outlines four traps that make it difficult for the poorest countries to escape
extreme poverty: **conflict**, **natural resources**, **being landlocked with bad
neighbors**, and **bad governance**. He explains that careful **aid**,
**military intervention**, **laws and charters**, and **trade** can combat economic
stagnancy.

### Conflict Trap

Conflict, in the form of civil war or a coup d’état, traps countries because
conflict tends to be repetitive. The loop is based on the reality that low
income and slow growth make a country prone to civil war and coups, which hinder
economic growth. Once violence breaks out, it is more likely to happen again in
the future.

Post-conflict areas benefit from aid in the form of basic services and
infrastructure. Military intervention, if the external military commits to about
a ten year presence, can help restore order and/or keep peace in the area. The
international community should also develop a charter for post conflict
situations that supports impartial norms, and draws from truth and reconciliation
experiences.

### Natural Resource Trap

Natural resources, in the context of poverty, usually do not generate prosperity
for the people. The idea of Dutch disease suggests that natural resource exports
cause a country’s currency to become more valuable against foreign currencies.
The country’s other export activities then become uncompetitive. Natural
resource revenues can also be volatile, and increase the risk of civil war.
Professor Collier focuses on the negative effects natural resources have on
democracy. He argues that natural resource surpluses inflate the public sector,
corrupt election practices, and most importantly, weaken political restraints.

Citizens of countries that import natural resources can help put pressure on
resource-rich country leaders to adopt international transparency standards (a natural resource charter),
regarding their natural resource industry. The
public should be aware of how governments award resource extraction contracts, how
much money the government makes, and how the government spends that
money.

### Landlocked with Bad Neighbors Trap

Being landlocked with bad neighbors greatly affects a country’s ability to
trade. A landlocked country depends on its coastal neighbors’ roads and ports to engage
in international trade. If the landlocked country has neighbors with
poor transportation infrastructure, exportation of primary and manufactured
products becomes expensive. A landlocked country could also trade with its
neighbors, but if neighboring countries are experiencing, for example,
government instability or violence, trade with the neighbors is also
problematic.

Professor Collier claims that in the 1990s, aid agencies began to focus more on
health, education, the environment, and country specific projects. The private
sector did not pick up the funding for roads from landlocked to coastal
countries. Reliable, overland thoroughfares remain fundamental. For countries of the Sahel close to Europe, air
freight could also be an option. With more education and information
infrastructure, the bottom billion could potentially break into global markets
with information services.

### Bad Governance Trap

Professor Collier argues against the long-time bottom billion strategy of trade
protection, and insists that low-income countries need the opportunity to trade
with richer countries. Protectionism doesn’t work because the often tiny
domestic markets of the bottom billion can not support enough competition or
growth. Furthermore, high trade barriers allow firms to maintain monopolies and
inflate prices for consumers. Corrupt governments prosper when they can simply protect businesses of their choice and profit off
imports.

Professor Collier believes that bad governance demands a charter for democracy,
to define not only elections, but also how candidates raise and spend campaign money 
before an election, and how to check and balance power after an election.
Professor Collier also trusts that once a country truly commits to reform,
donors can send temporary, skilled workers (technical
assistance). OECD member countries must realize that trade policy negotiation
allows for policy incoherence. When OECD member countries subsidize the
production of crops in their own countries, and place higher tariffs on
processed materials than on unprocessed materials from other countries, they do not help bottom
billion countries. The OECD would be wise to develop trade policy that supports
export diversification and global opportunities for bottom billion countries.
