I learn so much more from a book when I read actively, and write my own response
when I finish reading.

Active reading for me includes thinking about the main topics of the text and
identifying examples. I highlight lines that are significant to me, and take
notes regularly. Before I start reading, I like to record the chapter headings
on a separate piece of paper, so I already have an outline for my notes.

A reading response is a way for me to reflect on the text. With non-fiction
texts, I often simply summarize or focus on a few main points. Reading responses
get me thinking and writing, and help me remember what I learned. I refer to
Purdue Universityâ€™s [Online Writing Lab][1]{:target="_blank"} to help me
properly cite my work. I like to use the APA Formatting and Style Guide
to cite the [references][2]{:target="_blank"} and [quotations][3]{:target="_blank"} that I use.

I would love to read any reading responses you have for books that are
meaningful to you!
