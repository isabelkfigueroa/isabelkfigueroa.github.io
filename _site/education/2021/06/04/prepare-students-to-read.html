    <p>Students have a stronger start to any reading assignment when they gain some
contextualization before reading. As Michael McKenna and Richard Robinson
explain in <em>Teaching through Text</em> (2014), teachers can engage students in multiple
pre-reading activities. The authors focus on purposes, prior knowledge,
organization, and vocabulary. Questions that students and teachers may want to
address are: What is the original intention of this text and why is the reading
important for the class? What prior and additional knowledge is necessary to
understand this text? How does the layout of the text help create meaning?
Finally, which specific terms are fundamental to the meaning of the text?</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-this-text">What is the purpose of this text?</h1>

<p>Teachers and students may first want to consider the <strong>original purpose</strong> of the
text. Who is the author? Who is the publisher and what is the publication date?
Is the text informational? Is it a letter? If students gain some information
about the piece’s origins and intentions before they read, they might be better
able to predict and judge the facts or opinions they encounter.</p>

<p>Next, teachers can help students understand <strong>the class’s purpose</strong> for reading.
When teachers give students goals prior to reading, the students can direct
their concentration towards the most important parts of the text. Maybe
the best use of time is to look for answers to specific questions, or maybe the most helpful exercise is to look for examples of a theme.</p>

<h1 id="what-prior-knowledge-is-necessary-to-understand-this-text">What prior knowledge is necessary to understand this text?</h1>

<p>Before students engage a particular text, teachers should <strong>activate students’
prior knowledge</strong>. A student’s frame of reference includes experiences inside or outside of school that relate to the upcoming text.</p>

<p>Teachers might also need to <strong>provide additional information</strong> to students
before they read. Some basic facts, a timeline, a class discussion, or photos
may help students understand the reading.</p>

<h1 id="how-is-this-text-organized">How is this text organized?</h1>

<p>Students can acquire additional information about a text through a simple,
“<strong>Organizational Walk-Through</strong>” (p. 77). Before they begin to read, students
can note the major headings and subheadings to see the big picture of the
reading assignment. Some texts, like magazine articles, may include photos or
graphs that reveal big ideas.</p>

<p>A text about Ancient Greek art, for example, might communicate information chronologically,
beginning with Minoan art. Alternatively, the text might simply list and discuss
various subjects evident in Greek architecture, sculpture, and pottery. Students
may want to replicate the organization of the text for the organization of their
notes.</p>

<h1 id="what-vocabulary-is-necessary-to-understand-this-text">What vocabulary is necessary to understand this text?</h1>

<p>McKenna and Robinson explain that research confirms “…the need to <strong>introduce
terminology before students read</strong>, as a means of removing roadblocks to
comprehension” (p. 86). When teachers pre-teach the most significant words from
a text, they help students better understand their reading.</p>

<p>The authors argue that teachers must <strong>explicitly teach important vocabulary</strong>
they want students to know. Teachers shouldn’t assume that students
naturally come to understand the meaning of academic terminology because
context is often insufficient, and students probably won’t encounter the
technical terms frequently enough.</p>

<p>Teachers can introduce a reading assignment in many different ways. While the
particulars may vary, McKenna and Robinson argue that in order to maximize
comprehension, students require preparation before reading tasks.</p>
