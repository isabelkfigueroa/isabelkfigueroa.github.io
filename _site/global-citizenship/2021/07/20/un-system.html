    <p>The United Nations (UN) System consists of the United Nations (the six main bodies of the UN),
and various other organizations that work with the UN to achieve common goals.
Each organization has a different focus, such as children, the environment,
refugees, food, or health. The organizations below are just several of many
organizations within the UN System.</p>
