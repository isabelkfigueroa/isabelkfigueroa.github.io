    <h3 id="paul-farmers-mission">Paul Farmer’s Mission</h3>

<p>In <em>Pathologies of Power</em> (2003), physician and medical anthropologist, Dr. Paul Farmer, calls for direct and immediate action to increase quality health care for the poor. Dr. Farmer explains that the structural violence of our current global society makes poor people more likely to become ill and less likely to gain access to care, regardless of their personal choices. Dr. Farmer refers to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberation-theology" target="_blank">Liberation theology</a>, which emphasizes justice for the poor and oppressed. He stresses that the sick poor require a preferential option because the severity of their suffering warrants prioritization. Dr. Farmer is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.pih.org/pages/our-mission" target="_blank">Partners in Health</a>, an international non-profit organization that provides direct health care to those most in need.</p>

<h3 id="health-as-a-human-right">Health as a Human Right</h3>

<p><em>Pathologies of Power</em> argues that societies abuse human rights when they deny marginalized people access to quality health care. The United Nations’ <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html" target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> proclaims that all people have a right to a standard of living for the health and well-being of themselves and their families. Similarly, the World Health Organization’s <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/constitution" target="_blank">constitution</a> declares that the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of each individual. In reality, however, many people cannot maintain healthy lives because of the gross distribution of wealth in the world, and the commoditization of medicine. Charity and development are not enough to relieve the greatest suffering. <em>Pathologies of Power</em> advocates societal reform rooted in social justice.</p>

<h3 id="multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis">Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis</h3>

<p>The spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Russian prisons exemplifies structural violence and human rights abuse.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis (<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis" target="_blank">TB</a>) is an infectious, airborne disease caused by bacteria that attacks the lungs, and other body parts. Today, TB is preventable, treatable, and curable, but the disease still kills too many people that don’t have access to life saving medicine. Unfortunately, some TB patients receive intermittent therapy, which can induce the disease to acquire drug resistance. An infecting strain that is resistant to at least two of the most powerful first-line drugs, rifampicin and isoniazid, is called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (<a href="https://www.who.int/features/qa/79/en/" target="_blank">MDRTB</a>). Drug resistant TB requires a much longer, more expensive, period of treatment.</p>

<p>With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, jobs disappeared, and petty crime rose in Post-Soviet Russia. The courts became overwhelmed and mostly young men spent more time in crowded, pre-trial detention. Poorly ventilated prisons also became overpopulated, and provided the perfect breeding ground for TB. Prisons struggled to provide consistent treatment for infected detainees, causing MDRTB to spread. Thus, many poor, non-violent offenders in the Russian Federation began receiving an unofficial tuberculosis sentence as well as their official prison sentence.</p>

<p><em>Pathologies of Power</em> highlights the injustice of MDRTB in 2003, but in 2020, the disease remains a public health crisis.</p>
