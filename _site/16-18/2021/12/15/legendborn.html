<main id="legendborn-characters">
  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #178DE9">Victoria (Tor) Morgan, Scion of Sir Tristan</h1>
    <p>“A tall blond girl scowls...She’s beautiful the way a well-maintained dagger is beautiful: sharp, shiny, and all angles. A bit prissy. Absolutely Alice’s type” - Briana (p. 18)</p>
    <p>“‘Victoria Morgan. Goes by Tor. A serious legacy...Her daddy and granddaddy and whoever else all the way back to whenever went to UNC. Couple years ago, her fam donated so much $ to the B School they renamed a building after them. Old money good ol’ boys’” - Charlotte (p. 47)</p>
    <p>“‘Victoria is the Scion of the Line of Tristan, third-ranked, with Sarah as her squire... Marksmanship and speed’” - William (p. 137)</p>
    <p>“‘Yea, that was Tor’s rebellious phase. I think she did it just to piss her parents off...Dating a Merlin would piss any Legendborn parent off’” - Sarah (p. 335)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #CC0000">Felicity Caldwell, Scion of Sir Lamorak</h1>
    <p>“A curvy, short girl with wavy red hair…” - Briana (p. 88)</p>
    <p>“‘...Felicity is a Scion, born with the title like me…’” - Nick (p. 89)</p>
    <p>“‘Felicity is the Scion of Lamorak’s bloodline. Ranked fourth, as you know. She chose Russ as her Squire in last year’s tournament. After tonight, she’ll be strong enough to punch through a boulder…’” - William (p. 137)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #F3CF0C">Peter (Pete) Hood, Scion of Sir Owain</h1>
    <p>“I don’t know Pete at all, but I know he’s new, and kind” - Briana (p. 258)</p>
    <p>“I, Peter Herbert Hood, Scion of Sir Owain, seventh ranked, select Page Taylor as my Squire. With their agreement, we will be bonded. For this war and beyond” - Peter (p. 413)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #F08A2F">Fitzsimmons (Fitz) Baldwin, Scion of Sir Bors</h1>
    <p>“Fitz looks like he’s considering clobbering me” - Briana (p. 95)</p>
    <p>“‘Fitz is the Scion of Sir Bors, eleventh ranked. In combat, he has agility like you’ve never seen. When we take a Squire, we’re choosing a battle partner to join us in the Warrior’s Oath. Someone who will share our bloodline’s power. Fitz chose Evan as his Squire last year’” - William (p. 137)</p>
    <p>“‘Fitz’s way - his entire family’s way - is...dishonorable’” - William (p. 138)</p>
    <p>“...I see Fitz, cracking his knuckles like a prized fighter about to go in the ring” - Briana (p. 413)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #00FF00">William Sitterson, Scion of Sir Gawain</h1>
    <p>“...healer. Someone who helped me even though he doesn’t know my name” - Briana (p. 61)</p>
    <p>“The infirmary is William’s domain. He strides between the tables, his hands coated in silver aether so thick it looks like mercury. The bright, citrus smell of his aether signature fills the room” - Briana (p. 123)</p>
    <p>“William regards me with unreadable gray eyes” - Briana (p. 129)</p>
    <p>“I’m beginning to understand why Sel didn’t fight William’s will. He’s imperious without being arrogant, and has an uncanny knack for being right” - Briana (p. 133)</p>
    <p>“‘I’m the Scion of the Line of Sir Gawain, twelfth-ranked. In addition to enhanced healing, the Spell gave Gawain preternatural strength at midday and midnight...Gawain was an odd guy, what can I say’” - William (p. 137)</p>
    <p>“William runs a hand through his light hair and releases a long sigh” - Briana (p. 243)</p>
    <p>“‘I, William Jeffrey Sitterson, Scion of Sir Gawain, twelfth-ranked, select Page Whitlock as my Squire’” - William (p. 413)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #178DE9;">Sarah, Tor’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“...a pixielike girl with short dark hair...large dark eyes…” - Briana (p. 76)</p>
    <p>“Sarah steps forward...I’m surprised by her defense of me, someone she doesn’t know” - Briana (p. 125).</p>
    <p>“‘Can I drive you home?’” - Sarah (p. 143)</p>
    <p>“‘[My dad] is Venezuelan. But I pass, so people don’t realize I am too. Or they forget. They say racist crap around me sometimes...Sometimes I check ‘em. Sometimes I don’t bother’” - Sarah (p. 144)</p>
    <p>“Sel takes three determined strides toward me before Sarah slides between us. Even though the Merlin is the superior opponent with a foot of height on her, the pint-size girl glares up at him poised for a fight. The steel in her eyes tells me she’d put up a good one” - Briana (p. 145)</p>
    <p>“‘Back off Sel, I’m taking Bree to her dorm’” - Sarah (p. 146)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #CC0000">Russ Copeland, Felicity’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“...a tall, lanky boy with cropped brown hair...his jeans and wrinkled button-down shirt look like he’d plucked them from a sad pile of clothes on the floor” - Briana (p. 88)</p>
    <p>“His mischievous eyes immediately put me at ease” - Briana (p. 89)</p>
    <p>“...he brought me down to the infirmary...he came down to wait with me and offered me a sweatshirt” - Briana (p. 129, 124)</p>
    <p>“Then Russ jumps to his feet and whoops, triggering a wave of shouts and applause” - Briana (p. 331)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #F3CF0C">Greer Taylor, Pete’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“They’re basketball-player tall and lean, with long, muscled arms and legs. Their dirty-blond hair lies in a single braid over their shoulder, while a few shorter strands fall out the front of their slouchy gray knit cap. An unbuttoned, expensive-looking, slate-colored suit vest over an untucked denim shirt and cuffed jeans puts their look somewhere between designer and hipster. They’re also wringing their hands in front of their belt buckle in a nervous gesture that reminds me painfully of Alice” - Briana (p. 93)</p>
    <p>“Greer assesses me with their brown eyes and kind smile before stuffing another piece of gum in their mouth” - Briana (p. 94)</p>
    <p>“‘People say shit about me, too. But my parents are major donors. I come from six generations of Vassal service and three generations of Pages, and I’m white, so they get strategic about when and where. Some folks just don’t care to get better or learn more, and it shows’” - Greer (p. 100)</p>
    <p>“Greer shoots me a look of genuine apology...” - Briana (p. 258)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #F08A2F">Evan Cooper, Fitz’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“...the tall red-haired boy…” - Briana (p. 12)</p>
    <p>“Hey, hey...Let’s not bring drama to the dinner table” - Evan (p. 404)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #00FF00">James (Whitty) Whitlock, William’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“He has a stocky build with wild, pale curly hair, and he’s wearing a worn camo jacket and jeans. While the other kids are dressed for classes or the formality of the Lodge, Whitty’d look equally at home on a tractor or up a hunting blind. His casual indifference appeals to me immediately…” - Briana (p. 92)</p>
    <p>“‘The Whitlocks are Vassals to the Line of Tristan, and they own most of the pig farms out in Clinton’” - Nick (p. 92)</p>
    <p>“‘Thought we’d come over and introduce ourselves’” - Whitty (p. 93)</p>
    <p>“‘Put your knife down Schaefer.’ Whitty’s usually slow drawl is low with warning. ‘Nick can spend time talkin’ to his Page. Ain’t no harm there’” - Whitty (p. 184)</p>
