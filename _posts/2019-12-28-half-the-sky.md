Pulitzer Prize winners Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas Kristof champion gender
equality in their 2009 book, _Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity
for Women Worldwide_. The couple maintains that slavery and totalitarianism were
the most significant global injustices of the 19th and 20th century,
respectively. They argue that the 21st century’s greatest wrong is gender
inequality, which manifests most extremely as forced prostitution, gender-based
violence, and maternal mortality.

### Forced Prostitution

The first reason why forced prostitution proves difficult to combat is the controversy about prostitution in general. One strategy is to
legalize and regulate commercial sex among consenting adults, so that
all parties may benefit from legal protections. Another argument posits that
commercial sex is inherently wrong, and legalization and regulation policies do
not actually diminish a parallel, illegal industry. The authors share that
they believe legalized prostitution does not reduce the numbers
of exploited children or adults. Ms. WuDunn and Mr. Kristof stress, however, that
the debate around prostitution impedes action against forced prostitution.

To further complicate the mission to eradicate forced prostitution, is the reality
that the difference between forced and willing prostitution is not
always clear. Consider adult women who seem to be volitional sex workers. The
women may have been coerced in to sex work as children, forced to develop a
dependency on drugs, or made to feel so stigmatized by society, that while they
are free to leave, a new life doesn’t seem like a realistic option.

The authors suggest that we come away from the debate regarding legal vs.
illegal prostitution, and willing vs. forced prostitution, and focus more on
alternative vocational opportunities for women. To learn more about microfinance for

### Gender Based Violence

_Half the Sky_ highlights the many ways in which girls and women experience
violence specifically because of their gender: Research suggests that with the advancement of ultrasound technology, people began to abort female fetuses more often than male fetuses. Girl children tend to receive
less medical attention, food, and education compared to their brothers when resources diminish in a family, and women continue to suffer honor killings, genital cutting, and systematic rape.

The authors point out that both men and women internalize and reproduce the
misogynistic values that create cultures of violence against women. Mothers
sometimes give their daughters less care than their sons, and mothers-in-law and
women brothel managers often beat the younger women. Many
women also agree that in some situations, men have the right to beat
their wives.

Ms. WuDunn and Mr. Kristof press that education is one of the surest ways to
help people escape a mindset that subordinates women. They recommend support for
[_Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED)_][3]{:target="_blank"},
and the [_Afghan Institute of Learning_][4]{:target="_blank"}.

### Maternal Mortality

Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) indicates the number of maternal deaths for every
100,000 live births. In 1987, the United Nation’s Safe Motherhood Initiative
endeavored to reduce maternal mortality by 50 percent by the year 2000. Then, in
2000, the UN set a Millennium Development Goal to reduce maternal mortality by
75 percent by 2015. Neither goal was met. While childbirth can be dangerous for
women worldwide, it can be especially lethal to those that can’t receive
emergency obstetric care such as C-sections.

Maternal morbidity refers to injuries a mother sustains during pregnancy or
childbirth. For every woman that dies in childbirth, there are far more that
suffer significant injuries. Obstructed labor and lack of medical care during
childbirth can cause fistulas, for example. Fistulas are abnormal connections
between two parts of the body, and can cause death or lifelong problems for new mothers.
Fistulas are preventable and treatable at low costs.

The survival and well-being of mothers is the
priority of several effective organizations such as
[_Averting Maternal Death and Disability_][5]{:target="_blank"} and
[_Fistula Foundation_][6]{:target="_blank"}.
