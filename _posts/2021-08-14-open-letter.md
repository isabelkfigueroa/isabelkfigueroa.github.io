Dear Child,

I see advertisements for a [RiTANA](https://ritana.com.vn/) Skin Whitening
product in different places around Ho Chi Minh City. I’m sure you see them
too. I want to tell you why the advertisement is a problem.

On the billboard, the woman with darker skin has a frown on her face. She
stands with her head tilted, and her arms by her side. Her presence on the
billboard is smaller, and in the background. The company, RiTANA, wants you
to think that the woman with darker skin is unhappy, insecure, and does not
receive attention or praise.

In contrast, the woman with lighter skin has a smile on her face. She holds
her crowned head straight, and poses with her hand on her hip. Her presence
on the billboard is larger, and more centered in the foreground. The RiTANA company wants you to think that the woman with lighter skin is
happier, more confident, and receives more attention and glory than the
woman with darker skin.

The advertisement is problematic because it perpetuates the false idea that
light skin is better than dark skin. The contempt that the advertisement
shows for dark skin is an example of
[colorism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colorism). Just like
sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination, colorism is wrong. One
skin color is not superior to another; there is no hierarchy of skin color.

Although we see advertisements like this one, you and I can assure the
people around us that happiness, confidence, attention, and celebration are
for everyone.

Sincerely,

Isabel Figueroa
