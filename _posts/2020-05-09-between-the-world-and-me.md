In his 2015 open letter, _Between the World and Me_, author and journalist,
[Ta-Nehisi Coates][1]{:target="_blank"}, writes to his teenage son about what it
means to be black in the United States. Mr. Coates tells his son that he has
many privileges, but that life in a black body remains dangerous. Physical violence against black people is Mr. Coates’s greatest concern.

Mr. Coates suggests that all of the country’s contemporary, nuanced language to describe various race-based issues distracts the focus that must be placed on the most fundamental problem of violence. He insists,

> But all our phrasing - race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilige, even white supremacy - serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this. You must always remember that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body. (p. 9)

Conversations about race in living rooms and classrooms easily become detached from the more brutal reality. Whether the aggressor is white, black, or any other race, black people are too often the victims of violence. Mr. Coates urges his son not to lose sight of the most serious problem regarding issues of race.

Black people do not receive the same tolerance as white people, Mr. Coates warns his son.  He writes:

> ...the price of error is higher for you than it is for your countrymen, and so that America might justify itself, the story of a black body’s destruction must always begin with his or her error, real or imagined...our errors always cost us more. (pp. 95-96)

Mr. Coates cites the 2012 murder of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, and the 2014 death of twelve-year-old Tamir Rice. He names the 2013 shooting of Renisha McBride, and he references several deaths of black men at the hands of police officers in 2014: Eric Garner, John Crawford, and Michael Brown. Black people are constantly at risk, and as Mr. Coates argues, cannot hope for any assumption of innocence.

Despite an environment that is often hostile against black people, Mr. Coates does not want his son to feel as though he needs to change himself. He laments that black parents are often so afraid for their children, they “tell their black boys and girls to ‘be twice as good’” (p. 90), when the burden of change should not be on them. Mr. Coates encourages his son to find his way as an individual, without constraints. He tells his son, “You are growing into consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict yourself to make other people comfortable” (p. 107). Mr. Coates is grateful when the mother of a murdered black boy reinforces, more specifically, Mr. Coates’s own feelings. She stresses to Mr. Coates’s son:

> You exist. You matter. You have value. You have every right to wear your hoodie, to play your music as loud as you want. You have every right to be you. And no one should deter you from being you. You have to be you. And you can never be afraid to be you. (p. 113)
