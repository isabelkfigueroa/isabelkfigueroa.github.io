The International Baccalaureate Organization ([IBO](https://www.ibo.org/))
Spring 2021 workshop, “Learning Diversity and Inclusion,” highlights the
responsibility teachers have to make their curriculum accessible for all of
their students. The IBO workshop refers to the education research and
development organization, [CAST](https://www.cast.org/about/about-cast), to
share the principles of the Universal Design for Learning
([UDL](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/?lutm_medium=web)) framework.

Universal Design for Learning understands that every teacher needs to teach with diversity in mind because students bring unique combinations of skills,
learning preferences, and interests to the classroom. Teachers can show all
students that they are valued, included, and capable of success when they create
learning opportunities that account for student diversity.

First, teachers can **present new content in multiple ways**. When teachers
explicitly teach new facts, concepts and skills, they can provide students with
chances to read, listen, and view multiple kinds of media. The different
resources help all of the students connect to the learning objectives.

For each learning objective, teachers can provide students with some curated
options. When **students make some of their own choices**, and explore an
area that they find relevant, they are more likely to stay engaged and
motivated.

Finally, just as teachers can present content in different ways, teachers should
think about how **students can show their learning in different ways**. How one
individual student best demonstrates their mastery of a learning objective may
differ from another student!

The IBO aligns with the Universal Design for Learning framework because the IBO
strives to make meaningful learning accessible to all students.
