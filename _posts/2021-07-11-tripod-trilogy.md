John Christopher’s 1967 book, _The White Mountains_, highlights one boy’s struggle
to resist his world’s norms. Thirteen-year-old Will Parker lives in a world
where Tripods dominate the earth, and everyone he knows seems at peace with this
reality. People in Will’s life celebrate a Capping ceremony, where Tripods affix
a metal Cap to people’s skulls. Besides the Capping celebration, people avoid
discussions about the Tripods. When Will discovers that the Capping ceremony
everyone goes through is a way for the Tripods to control humans, he desperately
wants to retain his freedom. Even when Will discovers the truth, however,
resistance remains a challenge. Will must conquer his fear of the Tripods, and consistently resist the easier option to submit. Throughout _The White Mountains_,
Will faces challenges in his struggle against the Tripods.

# Challenge 1: Reject a celebrated rite of passage

Will only slowly begins to question the Capping ceremony because people treat the event as an honor that everyone must experience. Will’s
parents raise him to equate the Capping ceremony with “the mark of the adult,
the ceremony itself solemn and linked in one’s mind with the holiday and the
feast” (p. 34). Will’s parents teach him to accept the Capping ceremony as necessary for adulthood, and as an event that demands respect and gratitude. Will’s
best friend and older cousin, Jack, undergoes the Capping before Will does. Will
confesses that despite his suspicions, Jack’s Capping Day makes him feel that
the event is a time for “...rejoicing and making merry. [Jack] was a man, and
tomorrow would do a man’s work and get a man’s pay." Will admits, "I forgot my earlier fears,
and envied [Jack], and thought how next year I would be there, a man myself” (p.
18). Not only do Will’s parents endorse the Capping, but Will’s favorite older
cousin ultimately supports Capping as well. With so many people that he loves in
favor of the Capping, Will can’t help but feel the positivity around the event,
and he feels compelled to participate in the rite of passage himself. When Will
runs away to a completely new culture, he finds attitudes towards Capping that
are similar to the ones in his own town. Will lives with a noble French family,
and he observes that “For even more than their inferiors, they accepted and
looked forward to being Capped. It was a part of becoming a knight, or of
turning from girl to lady” (p. 120). In France, Capping is a celebrated
custom for upper class adolescents. If Will decides to remain uncapped, he goes
against a tradition that most people value.

# Challenge 2: Ask questions and breaks taboos

Another challenge Will faces in his defiance against the Tripods is that
information is difficult to obtain. When Will asks his cousin Jack what the
experience of Capping is like, Jack responds: “You know it’s not permitted to
talk about that. But I can promise you that you won’t be hurt” (p. 18). Jack
refuses to share details about his Capping, and tries to dismiss the topic with
a simple reassurance. However, Capping does not work on everyone. Those people
whose Capping goes wrong become “Vagrants,” or people that wander from place to
place for the rest of their lives. The topic of Vagrants is also taboo. For
Will, “What was known, though not discussed, was that the Vagrants were people
for whom the Capping had proved a failure…Children, generally, viewed them with
suspicion and avoided them” (p. 11 - 12). People avoid talk of the
Vagrants, and the Vagrants themselves. The same is true about the ancient cities, which remain from the time before the Tripods. Will explains: “I knew of the
ruined great-cities of the ancients, of course. But these, too, were little
talked of, and then with disapproval and a shade of dread. No one would dream of
going near them” (p. 13). People avoid conversations about the ancients because
the topic is distasteful and even frightening. People also avoid the spaces of
the ancients, so firsthand knowledge is limited. Capping, Vagrants, and the “the
ancients,” are not suitable topics of conversation in Will’s society, which
makes them difficult subjects to understand.

# Challenge 3: Overcome fear of the Tripods

When Will learns the truth about the Tripods, his challenges really begin. He
resolves to join a group of free people in the White Mountains, and evade
Capping. When he runs away, he lives in constant fear of the Tripods. On land,
the Tripods hunt him. He watches one Tripod rip up the earth’s vegetation in
search of him. He relates: “I saw more bushes sail through the air, like confetti. You do
not get used to fear, I thought; it grips you as firmly every time” (p. 193).
The Tripods’ great size and strength intimidate Will, and he believes that they
will never become less frightening. While on a ship, Will sees, hears, and feels
the Tripods crash by his vessel. Will realizes: “[The Tripods] dominated the
sea, as well as land. If I had thought about it, I suppose, I would have assumed
that. But I had not, and the reality depressed me” (p. 65). When Will sees how
the Tripods traverse the sea with ease, he understands that their reach is
almost unlimited. Furthermore, even a ship cannot protect him from a Tripod’s
strength. Aware of the far-reaching power of the Tripods, Will feels
discouraged. He wonders if the fight against the tripods is futile. He worries:
“The Tripods had conquered men when they were at the height of their power and
magnificence...If our ancestors, with all their strength had failed, how pitiful
was the defiance of a handful of men clinging to the slopes of barren mountains”
(p. 135). Will doubts that humans can overcome the Tripods. Now as an enemy of
the Tripods, Will fears for his life on land and water, and feels he might be on the losing side.

# Challenge 4: Resist the easy way

In contrast to a life of fear in opposition to the Tripods, is a potential life
of contentment in submission to the Tripods. Will knows, “All my elders were
Capped, and contended to be so” (p. 34). The Capped adults in Will’s life model
a seemingly happy adulthood. The norm he learns throughout his childhood
undoubtedly influences him. When Will comes to live with a family in France, in
them he also sees that “They were Capped, they accepted the Tripods and all they
stood for, but that did not prevent them from being, as I had seen in the Comte
and Comtesse and Eloise and now in others, warmhearted, generous and brave. And
happy” (p. 133). Will appreciates his life and the people around him at the
chateau where he lives. The people at the chateau have so many wonderful
qualities, and he wonders if being Capped is really so bad. He even considers
the benefits of being Capped: “When the Cap was put on, the doubts vanished. How
great a loss was that? Was it a loss at all? The Tripods, apart from the act of
Capping itself, did not seem to interfere much with men” (p. 133). Will understands
that Caps dissolve all the uneasy questions about life.

In order to be free, Will must reject a major celebratory norm in his culture,
raise uncomfortable questions, bravely overcome his fear of the Tripods, and
resist the easier alternative. Will wants to “live among men whose minds are
their own, who do not accept the dominion of the Tripods” (p. 213). As _The
White Mountains_ illustrates, however, to act upon beliefs can be immensely
challenging.
