Lois Lowry’s 1989 novel, _Number the Stars_, refers to several real events in
[Denmark](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Denmark/@53.2712158,6.0106254,5.16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x464b27b6ee945ffb:0x528743d0c3e092cd!8m2!3d56.26392!4d9.501785)
during the time of the
[Holocaust](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/introduction-to-the-holocaust).
The story centers around the spread of a warning and subsequently, the
large-scale rescue of Jewish people in Denmark. In 1943, German diplomat, George
Ferdinand Duckwitz, tells Danish authorities about the Nazi plan to deport the
Jewish people from Denmark. Danish resisters and Jewish leaders, including Rabbi
Marcus Melchior, spread the information. Danes then help thousands of Jewish
people escape the Nazis in Denmark.

In _Number the Stars_, Annemarie Johansen’s family and neighbors become aware of
an upcoming Nazi raid. Annemarie’s father tells her that the Nazis “...plan to arrest all
the Danish Jews. They plan to take them away” (p. 35). Mr. Johansen’s knowledge
mirrors real events from September 1943, as the Nazis do plan to take all
Jewish people from Denmark. German diplomat, Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz,
warns the Danish authorities of the Nazi plan. The warning gives Danish
resisters and the Jewish community time to act.

In Lowry's story, Annemarie’s father explains: “This morning, at the synagogue, the
rabbi told his congregation that the Nazis have taken the synagogue lists of all
the Jews. Where they live, what their names are” (p. 35). At a real synagogue in Copenhagen, Rabbi Marcus Melchior
tells congregants that the planned Nazi raid coincides with the Jewish New
Year, Rosh Hashanah. He urges Jewish people to act immediately; they all must
leave or hide in order to escape the Nazis.

Mr. Johansen shares with Annemarie what he knows of the Nazi deportation plan:
“We don’t know where, and we don’t really know why. They call it ‘relocation.’
We don’t even know what that means. We only know that it is wrong, and it is
dangerous, and we must help” (p. 35). Mr. Johansen’s words reflect the feelings
and actions of real Danes. Once Denmark knows what the Nazis plan to do, Danes
support the escape of more than 7,000 Jewish people. Danes help many Jewish
refugees flee Nazi-occupied Denmark by boat to unoccupied Sweden.
