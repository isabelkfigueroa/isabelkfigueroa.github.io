The International Committee of the Red Cross ([ICRC](https://www.icrc.org/en))
is an independent, neutral organization that helps people in violent situations
and promotes international humanitarian law. ICRC Headquarters are in Geneva,
Switzerland, along with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC). The IFRC helps coordinate the 192 National Societies
that operate in countries around the world. The ICRC, IFRC, and National
Societies belong to the overarching International Red Cross and Red Crescent
Movement.

[7 Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent
Movement](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/fundamental-principles-red-cross-and-red-crescent):

**Humanity** → The Movement responds to human suffering, respects human dignity,
and promotes international humanitarian law.

**Impartiality** → Members of the Movement help all victims of violence,
prioritize those victims in greatest need, and make unbiased decisions solely
according to the needs of the victims.

**Neutrality** → The Movement does not express support or disapproval for any
Party during an armed conflict or for any side of a controversy.

**Independence** → The Movement remains autonomous in order to avoid pressure or
interference from other entities.

**Voluntary service** → Members of the Movement solely want to help people in
need.

**Unity** → Only one National Society exists per country. The National Society
serves throughout the territory and employs diverse members.

**Universality** → As suffering is global, the Movement’s response is global.
Each National Society within the Movement has equal status and is equally
responsible for the Movement’s integrity.
