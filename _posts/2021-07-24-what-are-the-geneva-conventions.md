The [Geneva Conventions and their Additional
Protocols](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/geneva-conventions-1949-additional-protocols)
are a collection of rules that protect people during times of war. The
Conventions and Protocol I generally apply to international armed conflicts.

However, Article 3 in each of the Conventions explains that in any armed
conflict, regarding people that are not a part of combat, or no longer a part of
combat, enemy forces may not: use violence, take hostages, inflict indignities,
or sentence without fair judgement. Article 3 also demands that wounded and sick
people receive care [(Convention I, Article
3)](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=BAA341028EBFF1E8C12563CD00519E66).

The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols underpin the International
Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which consists of: The International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC), and 192 National Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.
