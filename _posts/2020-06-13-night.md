In his work, _Night_ (1958/2006), Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel recounts his experience of the Nazi genocide against Jewish people during World War II. He urges people to fight against persecution around the world, and against the indifference that allows tragedies to happen.


# Persecution

One of the first examples of persecution in Elie's hometown of Sighet, Romania, is the 1941 removal of non-national Jewish people. After the mass deportation, the town carries on as normal. Misinformation spreads, and the townspeople try to reason, optimistically, and wrongly, that the removed people still live productive, happy lives (p. 5).

Three years later, the German army arrives in Sighet, and the Germans arrest Jewish community leaders. Edicts begin to deny the remaining Jewish people in the town their freedoms. First, all Jewish people must adhere to a three day travel ban. Next, Jewish people lose the right to own valuables, visit restaurants, travel by train, be in public in the evening, or attend synagogue. One edict orders Jewish people to wear yellow stars, to publicly identify themselves as Jewish (p. 10).

In Spring of 1944, the Nazi regime forces the Jewish people in Sighet out of their homes and into two crowded ghettos (p. 10). Not long after the formation of the ghettos, German and Hungarian officers gather the Jewish people, including fifteen-year-old Elie, his parents, and three sisters, into cattle cars that take them to the extermination and concentration camps at [Auschwitz][1]{:target="_blank"}.

Elie Wiesel’s memories of the time even before his deportation to the Nazi camps illustrate how many policies over several years take rights away from Jewish people. The progression of persecution serves as a crucial warning to today’s society.

# Indifference

As the Hungarian police forcibly relocates Elie and his family in preparation of the journey to Auschwitz, Elie remembers, “From behind their windows, from behind their shutters, our fellow citizens watched as we passed” (p. 19). Elie’s words communicate that many of those who evade persecution, and remain in the safety of their own homes, witness the abuse of others and choose to do nothing.

At Auschwitz, SS guards with machine guns separate Elie and his father from Elie’s mother and three sisters, and Elie never sees his mother or youngest sister again. After several weeks at one camp, SS guards take Elie and his father, along with other prisoners, to another camp. Elie recalls:

> As we were passing through some of the villages, many Germans watched us, showing no surprise. No doubt they had seen quite a few of these processions...On the way, we saw some young German girls. The guards began to tease them. The girls giggled...They all were laughing, joking, and passing love notes to one another. (p. 45)

In one group, Elie and the other prisoners endure the grossest human rights abuses. The other group, of free people, spends time normally, happy to socialize and flirt. The scene reveals the ability, even tendency, of people to ignore human suffering in favor of their own light-hearted fun.

When Elie is sixteen, SS guards move Elie and his father, among others, to [Buchenwald][2]{:target="_blank"} concentration camp. The guards press their prisoners into roofless cattle cars and move them through the snowfall. In the freezing conditions, with no food, many people die along the way. At each stop, the SS guards demand the prisoners throw the bodies of the dead out of the cars. Elie remembers a time when a few pieces of food do come their way:

> Occasionally, we would pass through German towns. Usually, very early in the morning. German laborers were going to work. They would stop and look at us without surprise. One day when we had come to a stop, a worker took a piece of bread out of his bag and threw it into a wagon. There was a stampede. Dozens of starving men fought desperately over a few crumbs. The worker watched the spectacle with great interest. (p. 100)

The free workers do not reveal shock or horror at the sight of cattle cars full of starving, freezing people. Far from charity or compassion, the toss of bread from one of the workers reflects a fleeting attention to the immediate. The worker looks for a reaction, without any thought toward the condition of the people inside the cars.

In _Night_, Elie Wiesel experiences Nazi persecution, and witnesses societal indifference. He stresses that silence and inaction cannot be the responses to injustice.
