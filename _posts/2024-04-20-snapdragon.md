Before Snapdragon meets “the town witch,” Jacks, Snapdragon suspects that Jacks
eats pets. In Kat Leyh’s 2020 graphic novel, _Snapdragon_, when the titular character
meets Jacks, however, she quickly finds Jacks to be a caring and capable
adult. Jacks helps Snap’s injured dog, Good Boy, and Snap appreciates Jacks's animal caretaking skills. Jacks begins to teach Snap how to care for
animals herself. While at Jacks’s house, Snap also sees the articulation work
that Jacks does. Jacks explains to Snap that she collects the bones of dead
animals and carefully puts the bones back together. Jacks then sells the
skeletons to people for museum, education, or collection purposes. In addition to
the animal caretaking, Jacks begins to teach Snap how to put animal bones back
together. After many productive days together, Snap discovers that Jacks can use
magic. Snap begs Jacks to teach her magic, too, and Jacks agrees. Throughout
their time together, Jacks serves as an effective teacher to Snap, as she
models the correct way to do work, allows Snap to practice on her own, and gives
Snap positive feedback when Snap does well.

# Demonstrations

In order to teach Snap new skills, Jacks first models the skills. After Jacks
helps Snap’s dog, Good Boy, Snap brings Jacks a litter of orphaned possums in
hopes that Jacks can care for the baby possums as well. Jacks tells Snap: “I’ll
keep them possums here. But you gotta take care of ‘em. I’ll even show you how”
(p. 20). Upon this second meeting, Jacks initiates the first of many learning
experiences for Snap. Jacks agrees to house and support the baby possums if Snap
also helps take care of them. Jacks shows Snap how to properly feed the baby
possums in order to keep them alive. Next, Jacks teaches Snap the skill of articulation, or how to put animal skeletons back together. Snap watches as
Jacks models how to arrange the bones. Snap inquires about her movements, and
Jacks replies that she is: “Puttin’ the spine of this rabbit together. The order
of the vertebrae gotta be right” (p. 60). Jacks uses specific anatomic vocabulary
to explain what she does during the process. Jacks shows Snap that while some
bones look similar, they have important distinctions and their placement
matters. Later, Snap discovers that Jacks can use magic and Snap asks Jacks to
teach her. Jacks shows how she uses magic and advises: “Magic is a matter of
will. No words…no props…You need nothing but yourself” (p. 130). As Jacks
speaks, she simultaneously uses magic to quickly plant and grow seeds in the
ground. She narrates her actions to show Snap what she means. Jacks uses only
her hands, no spells or wands, to control the seeds. For each new skill that
Jacks teaches Snap, Jacks first demonstrates herself, so that Snap can see what
to do.

# Practice

Once Jacks shows Snap the way to do something, Jacks gives Snap opportunities to
practice.  First, Jacks shows Snap how to feed the baby possums. Then, Jacks
allows Snap to feed the possums herself. As Snap feeds the possums, Jacks guides
her, and says: “That’s it. Let ‘em eat at their own pace. Don’t let any get in
their nose. They’re nearly ready to eat on their own” (p. 58). In this instance,
Snap holds a baby possum, and bottle feeds the animal by herself. Jacks
watches and guides while Snap does the work with her own hands. Regarding the reconstruction of animal
bones, Jacks begins to create opportunities for Snap to become more hands-on as
well. Jacks says to Snap: “Once I bend the spine into the right shape, you can
help sort the toe bones” (p. 68). Jacks teaches Snap the process of
reconstruction and allows Snap to participate in one small way at first. Jacks makes Snap's initial participation manageable so Snap can find success. After Jacks models the use of magic, she encourages Snap to try for herself. Jacks
instructs Snap: “See if you can reach out to ‘im. Close your eyes. Concentrate.
Try warmin’ your hands. Focus on the warmth of your palms…imagine it’s a
light…no, don't hold your breath. Focus. Now try” (pp. 148-149). Jacks instructs
Snap to use her own magic to connect with the ghost of a squirrel. Jacks watches
beside Snap and gives specific instructions to help Snap use her own magic.
Jacks explains what Snap must think about in her mind and must do with her
hands. When Snap starts to hold her breath, Jacks quickly tells her to stop.
Under Jacks’s careful watch, Jacks lets Snap practice animal care, bone
articulation, and the use of magic.

# Praise

Jacks demonstrates new skills, allows Snap to practice the skills, and praises
Snap when she does well. Jacks shows Snap how to feed baby possums, but the
first time Snap feeds the possums, she feels that her form may not be correct.
Jacks assures Snap: “I watched you...You did a fine job. Believe
me, I’d tell ya if ya didn’t” (p. 59). Jacks lets Snap know that she does pay
close attention to Snap’s work. Jacks gives Snap her approval, and stresses that
Snap can expect a correction if she does something wrong. Jacks gives Snap
positive feedback while Snap feeds the possums to give Snap confidence in the
moment. Jacks also introduces Snap to the scientific art of articulation - or
the reconstruction of animal bones. Snap helps Jacks with the work for a while,
and when Snap offers to continue to help Jacks with the skeletons, Jacks
replies, “Yeah, the extra help has been good. Yer doin’ a good job” (p. 117).
Jacks approves of Snap’s proposal to continue with the articulation work. Jacks
explicitly tells Snap that she does good work, and that Jacks finds her work
useful. After several magic lessons, Jacks allows Snap to try magic herself.
Jacks supervises several occasions while Snap practices. In a moment of danger,
Snap finally uses her own magic effectively in front of Jacks. With the danger
under control, Jacks tells Snap: “I’m impressed with how you handled yourself,
kid. You did good” (p. 208). Jacks tells Snap that Snap’s performance of magic
exceeds expectations. Jacks explicitly communicates her approval to Snap in the
moment. Jacks’s praise of Snap’s good animal caretaking, articulation skills,
and magic skills, provides Snap with the positive reinforcement she needs.

At first, Snap feels unsure of Jacks. Snap hears rumors about Jacks, and sees
that Jacks’s clothes and house are out of the ordinary. Snap soon comes to
learn, however, that despite the rumors and her outward appearance, Jacks is a
kind and practical teacher. Jacks, a master of several skills that interest
Snap, begins to teach Snap what she knows. Jacks teaches Snap how to properly
care for animals, how to piece together bones, and how to use magic. For each
skill, Jacks first models the behavior. Jack shows and tells Snap clearly what
to do. Next, Jacks supervises while Snap practices. Jacks watches and supports
Snap as Snap tries to emulate Jacks’s actions. Finally, Jacks tells Snap when
she does good work so that Snap stays confident and motivated. Jacks’s
educational strategy helps Snap understand the principles, gain practice, and
get feedback. The way that Jacks teaches Snap new skills empowers Snap to slowly
master the skills. In the end, Snap shows that she can do what Jacks can do.
