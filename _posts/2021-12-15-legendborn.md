Tracy Deonn’s _Legendborn_ (2020), follows Briana Matthews as she meets a full cast of complex characters. Most of the characters are around the same age and attend the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. The new people that Briana comes to know exhibit various backgrounds, physical traits, preferences, and behaviors. A simple character chart can help track each character’s development. The character chart below includes descriptions, as well as the words and actions of ten of the new people that Briana meets.

    <p>“‘Victoria Morgan. Goes by Tor. A serious legacy...Her daddy and granddaddy and whoever else all the way back to whenever went to UNC. Couple years ago, her fam donated so much $ to the B School they renamed a building after them. Old money good ol’ boys’” - Charlotte (p. 47)</p>

    <p>“...healer. Someone who helped me even though he doesn’t know my name” - Briana (p. 61)</p>
    <p>“The infirmary is William’s domain. He strides between the tables, his hands coated in silver aether so thick it looks like mercury. The bright, citrus smell of his aether signature fills the room” - Briana (p. 123)</p>
    <p>“William regards me with unreadable gray eyes” - Briana (p. 129)</p>
    <p>“I’m beginning to understand why Sel didn’t fight William’s will. He’s imperious without being arrogant, and has an uncanny knack for being right” - Briana (p. 133)</p>
    <p>“‘I’m the Scion of the Line of Sir Gawain, twelfth-ranked. In addition to enhanced healing, the Spell gave Gawain preternatural strength at midday and midnight...Gawain was an odd guy, what can I say’” - William (p. 137)</p>

    <p>“Sel takes three determined strides toward me before Sarah slides between us. Even though the Merlin is the superior opponent with a foot of height on her, the pint-size girl glares up at him poised for a fight. The steel in her eyes tells me she’d put up a good one” - Briana (p. 145)</p>
    <p>“‘Back off Sel, I’m taking Bree to her dorm’” - Sarah (p. 146)</p>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #CC0000">Russ Copeland, Felicity’s Squire</h1>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #F3CF0C">Greer Taylor, Pete’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“They’re basketball-player tall and lean, with long, muscled arms and legs. Their dirty-blond hair lies in a single braid over their shoulder, while a few shorter strands fall out the front of their slouchy gray knit cap. An unbuttoned, expensive-looking, slate-colored suit vest over an untucked denim shirt and cuffed jeans puts their look somewhere between designer and hipster. They’re also wringing their hands in front of their belt buckle in a nervous gesture that reminds me painfully of Alice” - Briana (p. 93)</p>
    <p>“Greer assesses me with their brown eyes and kind smile before stuffing another piece of gum in their mouth” - Briana (p. 94)</p>
    <p>“‘People say shit about me, too. But my parents are major donors. I come from six generations of Vassal service and three generations of Pages, and I’m white, so they get strategic about when and where. Some folks just don’t care to get better or learn more, and it shows’” - Greer (p. 100)</p>
    <p>“Greer shoots me a look of genuine apology...” - Briana (p. 258)</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 style="background-color: #00FF00">James (Whitty) Whitlock, William’s Squire</h1>
    <p>“He has a stocky build with wild, pale curly hair, and he’s wearing a worn camo jacket and jeans. While the other kids are dressed for classes or the formality of the Lodge, Whitty’d look equally at home on a tractor or up a hunting blind. His casual indifference appeals to me immediately…” - Briana (p. 92)</p>
    <p>“‘The Whitlocks are Vassals to the Line of Tristan, and they own most of the pig farms out in Clinton’” - Nick (p. 92)</p>
    <p>“‘Thought we’d come over and introduce ourselves’” - Whitty (p. 93)</p>
    <p>“‘Put your knife down Schaefer.’ Whitty’s usually slow drawl is low with warning. ‘Nick can spend time talkin’ to his Page. Ain’t no harm there’” - Whitty (p. 184)</p>
