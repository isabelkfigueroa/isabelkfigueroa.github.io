Both Malcolm X (b. 1925) and Judy Heumann (b. 1947), grow up in a country that
tells them they are different, and undeserving of full participation in society.
Malcolm X’s work, _The Autobiography of Malcolm X_ (1965), and Judy Heumann’s
memoir, _Being Heumann_ (2020), show how years of socialization cause Malcolm and Judy to become accustomed to the dominant culture’s discrimination against people of color and people with disabilities, respectively. As young
adults, however, they begin to change again. Both Malcolm X and Judy Heumann
start to see that their marginalization is unjust, and that others like them
also suffer.  They begin to believe that American society can do better, and they
demand improvement. The lives of Malcolm X and Judy Heumann illustrate how individuals can be victims of their culture, and how they can institute positive change.

# Words

Malcolm’s 8th grade English teacher, a white man named Mr. Ostrowski, asks
Malcom what sort of work he would like to do as an adult. When Malcolm tells Mr.
Ostrowski that he would like to be a lawyer, Mr. Ostrowski insists that a law
career is not a realistic goal for a black person. The exchange exposes Malcolm
to the dominant society’s view of him. He relates: “It was a surprising thing
that I had never thought of it that way before, but I realized that…apparently I
was still not intelligent enough, in their eyes, to become whatever _I_ wanted
to be” (p. 44). The conversation Malcolm has with Mr. Ostrowski teaches him that
no matter how talented he is, or how hard he works, there is no expectation for
him to ever occupy a position of power in the community. Malcolm X recalls,
“That’s when I began to change - inside. I drew away from white people. I came
to class, and I answered when called upon. It became a physical strain simply to
sit in Mr. Ostrowski’s class” (p. 44). Malcolm begins to feel withdrawn and
unmotivated, not because of the color of his skin, but because of a respected
teacher’s low expectations of him.

As a child, words of rejection also change Judy Heumann. One day, while in her
wheelchair on the sidewalk, a child she doesn’t know rudely asks her if she is
sick. She shares, “I saw myself through his eyes, and the light around me
shifted…It was the world and how it saw me. The world thought I was sick…I
wasn’t expected to be a part of the world” (p. 13). In one moment on the street,
Judy becomes painfully aware of how others judge her. Each experience of
exclusion thus far in her life suddenly makes sense. She feels: “I was a
butterfly, becoming a caterpillar…I was self-conscious now of feeling changed in
some unspeakable way I didn’t fully understand. After that day, nothing was ever
quite the same” (p. 13-14). Judy’s disability does not make her inherently
self-conscious. Instead, people’s consistent reactions to her finally convince
her that there is something wrong with her.

# Messages

In an all white school, Malcolm understands that the white people will tolerate
him and be friendly if he remains within the boundaries they designate.
Regarding coed situations at school, and specifically at school dances: “...I
could sense it almost as a physical barrier, that despite all the beaming and
smiling, the mascot wasn’t supposed to dance with any of the white girls. It was
some kind of psychic message…” (p. 36). The understanding he develops is that as
the only black boy (the mascot) at the school, he must not become too friendly
with the white girls at school. He explains how he regulates his behavior in response: “I would just stand around and
smile and talk and drink punch and eat sandwiches, and then I would make some
excuse and get away early…I had become fairly adept at avoiding the white girl
issue…” (p. 36 - 37). In his youth, Malcolm understands that his school
community expects him to feel grateful for the level of inclusion the school
offers him, and that he must not try to integrate himself completely.

Society sends a similar message to Judy Heumann, the girl who uses a wheelchair.
She understands that, “No one expected me to date. I was ‘crippled’ and was
often told, whether explicitly and implicitly, that no boy would ever give me a
second look” (p. 31). The message to Judy is that people without disabilities are not
romantically interested in people with disabilities. An boyfriend without a disability is not an
option and she seems not to dwell on the matter. Like Malcolm, Judy acts accordingly: “So in high school, I didn’t date. I talked
on the phone and studied.” (p. 32). Judy engages in ways that others communicate are
available and appropriate for her; she can speak to friends and work hard at
school.

# Acceptance

For a time in his life, Malcolm X lives with the common justification for the
segregation and degradation of black people. He reflects on his thinking at the time:
“Mine was the same psychology that makes Negroes even today, though it bothers
them down inside, keep letting the white man tell them how much ‘progress’ they
are making. They’ve heard it so much they’ve almost gotten brainwashed into
believing it - or at least accepting it” (p. 35). The dominant thinking in
society is that although marginalized, black people have far more privileges in 20th century America
than during slavery in 19th centruy America. The idea is that black people
should be satisfied with the reality that they are no longer enslaved, and
should continue to conform to the dominant white world.

Judy reflects on the many times in her life when she is unable to participate
because some program, form of transportation, or building is inaccessible. She
remembers a summer camp during her childhood specifically. The basement of the
camp is inaccessible to people who use wheelchairs. Judy’s parents agree that
Judy doesn’t have to be with the other children when they go to the basement
because they are grateful that Judy is able to attend the camp at all.
Judy explains, “...parents needed us kids to adjust and accept not participating
\- and we learned to do this. We accepted that our inclusion was dependent on
someone else being ‘nice’” (p. 26). Judy and her family don’t want to ask for too much, to cause any problems, so they accept Judy's exclusion for part of the day.

# Awakening

In 1946, at the age of twenty, Malcolm X goes to prison. He begins to hear about
the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, and shares, “I still marvel at how swiftly my
previous life’s thinking pattern slid away from me, like snow off a roof…” (p.
196).  Elijah Muhammad teaches him to think of himself not just as an
individual, but as one of many black men in the context of racist America.
Malcolm X explains that Elijah Muhammad’s words, “...gave me something to think
about. The black prisoner, [Elijah Muhammad] said, symbolized white society’s
crime of keeping black men oppressed and deprived and ignorant, and unable to
get decent jobs, turning them into criminals” (p. 195). In prison, Malcom
studies American society and learns how groups of people are products not only
of their personal choices, but also their environments. When he leaves prison,
Malcolm X fights injustice in America for the rest of his life.

In 1970, the New York City Board of Education denies Judy Heumann (a qualified,
twenty-two-year-old college graduate) her teaching license on account of her
disability. She remembers of the event, “A dam had broken. After all this time,
all the years of being ignored and dismissed, I felt…an opportunity to call
attention and start to make it right” (p. 58). Judy Heumann begins to fight back
against the status quo. She feels that her exclusion from teaching is part of a
bigger problem. She thinks not only of herself, but, “...about all the people.
Yes, I did want to be a teacher, but in my mind, it was about all the stories
I’d heard about someone’s brother or sister, or their father, their mother,
their cousin, or they themselves—and how they had this problem or that problem
and no one was listening and things weren’t happening” (p. 58). The unjust
denial of her teaching license spurs Judy Heumann into action to defend the
rights of all people with disabilities.

# Travel

Malcolm X gains confidence in his cause during his travels to the Middle-East and Africa. He
insists, “But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced
me to _re-arrange_ much of my thought-patterns previously held, and to toss
aside some of my previous conclusions" (p. 391). Malcolm X’s experiences in
countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia help him to see that not all societies
are like American society. Along the pilgrimage, he witnesses thousands of
pilgrims: “They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned
Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit
of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe
never could exist between the white and the non-white” (p. 390). Malcolm X sees
Muslims of all races practice their religion side by side. He sees that white
people and people of color can exist peacefully, together.

Judy Heumann’s trip abroad also inspires her. She writes that her trip to
Europe, “...opened my eyes to the fact that how we did things in the US was not
the norm everywhere. My entire trip had a profound impact on me. It made me see
things in a different way than I had before” (p. 156). Judy Heumann sees that
other countries have different policies and practices than the United States.
She relates the effect of these different policies in action:

> Right away, it was the countries with universal healthcare that impressed me
> the most, the way their concept of healthcare extended far beyond our idea
> of healthcare…In some countries, housing authorities received money to work
> with people to modify their houses or apartments and make them accessible,
> whether they rented or owned…I got to learn about Sweden’s social welfare
> system - and how it provided financial security, healthcare, and social
> services, protecting Swedish society.

Judy Heumann becomes convinced that people with disabilities do not need to
lower their expectations in life. Instead, infrastructure and policies can
change.

# Demands

Malcolm X decides that in order to fight injustice, he must oppose specific
injustices. One night in Harlem, two white police officers break up an
altercation between black men. The police officers order passers-by to move
along, and when one witness - Johnson Hinton - stays by the scene, the police
beat him. Malcolm X and other members of the Nation of Islam learn of the
incicdent, go to the police station, and demand to see Johnson Hinton. Malcolm X
insists that Johnson Hinton go to the hospital. Malcolm X and the others follow
the ambulance along the streets and gather attention. That night, “The crowd was
big, and angry, behind the Muslims in front of Harlem Hospital. Harlem’s black
people were long since sick and tired of police brutality. And they never had
seen any organization of black men take a firm stand as we were” (p. 269).
As a grown man, Malcolm X sees that American society is flawed but also changeable, and
that he - not society - is the one worthy of acceptance.

Once Judy Heumann learns that too many people suffer because of exclusion, and
that life for these many people could be different, she begins to refuse the
state of society. She comes to understand that, “Inevitably, being ignored puts
you in the position of having to choose between making a fuss or accepting the
silent treatment. If you stand up to the ignorer and get in their face, you
break the norms of polite behavior…” (p. 143). Judy Heumann knows that society
does not want to change, because change can require effort and money. When human
rights are ignored, however, she knows that she must object loudly and take action that is impossible to ignore. She and several other activists go to the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to demand that Secretary
Califano sign the regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Guards at HEW deny the protestors entry to the building, so Judy Heumann fights
back. She remembers: “Then, I drove my chair directly toward the building. The
guards jumped to the side and watched me, frozen in total disbelief, as I
smashed into the door” (p. 142). After weeks of protest, Secretary Califano
signs the regulations into law, and Judy Heumann and her fellow activists
achieve their objective.

Born in 20th century America about twenty years apart, the lives of Malcolm X
and Judy Heumann follow the same journey of acculturation, then resistance.
American society teaches Malcolm X that he is not an equal citizen because he is black. The same society teaches Judy Heumann she cannot fully
participate because of her physical disability. Although American society is
flawed, the society deems Malcolm X and Judy Heumann, and many others like them,
as the flawed ones. Disparaging views of people of color and people with
disabilities are so pervasive, that even those people who are excluded from
society come to accept the views. Despite society’s efforts, however, Malcolm X
and Judy Heumann ultimately return to their original instinct that they are no
less than anyone else. They challenge the United States to evolve and to
broaden the nation's narrow understanding of the deserving human being.
