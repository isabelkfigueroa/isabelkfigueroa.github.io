I"E<p>In his memoir, <em>Black Boy</em>, originally published in 1945, Richard Wright shows
the fundamental role literature plays in his life. While Wright battles hunger,
anxiety, alienation, and racial discrimination throughout the work, literature
proves to be a unique source of empowerment.</p>

<h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>

<p>Through Ella, a young black school teacher, Wright experiences the magic of the
folktale. Ella boards at the home of Wright’s grandparents, and Wright often
wonders about her books. When he finally finds enough courage to approach Ella,
she tells him the story of <em>Bluebeard and His Seven Wives</em>, a folktale perhaps
most famously rendered by the 17th century, French author, Charles Perrault, who
also created <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, and <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>.
Wright recalls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As she spoke, reality changed, the look of things altered, and the world
became peopled with magical presences…Ella’s whispered story of deception and
murder had been the first experience in my life that had elicited from me a
total emotional response. (p. 39-40)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ella’s story completely enlivens Wright. Her words help him exercise his ability
to look at the world from a different point of view, and foster Wright’s own
imagination and creativity. Wright’s experience with Ella showcases the value of
adults sharing the world of literature with children.</p>

<h1 id="adventure">Adventure</h1>

<p>A boy at school introduces Wright to pulp magazines - adventures on paper. To
make money for food, and to find reading material, the classmate suggests to
Richard that he sell a weekly newspaper. The newspaper comes with a magazine
supplement that features thrilling stories, such as <em>Riders of the Purple Sage</em>,
an early 20th century Western by Zane Grey. Wright describes his interest in the
magazine’s stories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…I would go to my room and lock the door and revel in outlandish exploits of
outlandish men in faraway, outlandish cities. For the first time in my life I
became aware of the life of the modern world, of vast cities, and I was
claimed by it; I loved it. (p. 129)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From his own room, Wright is able to access an infinite number of environments,
characters, and dramas. Reading allows Wright to transcend the limitations of
his own reality, and enjoy an adventure all by himself.</p>

<h1 id="culture">Culture</h1>

<p>As an eighteen year old, Wright comes across a white man’s passionate criticism
of American culture. Wright first finds an article that condemns a writer named
H.L. Mencken in the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Distrustful of the Southern
paper, Wright wonders who H.L. Mencken could be. Wright obtains H.L. Mencken’s <em>A
Book of Prefaces</em>, a collection of essays that offers an oppositional view of the
United States. Wright explains Mencken’s effect on him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon,
using them as one would use a club. Could words be weapons? Well, yes, for
here they were. Then, maybe, perhaps, I could use them as a weapon? (p. 248)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wright is amazed that a white man so boldly denounces many of the dominant
values of the United States, values Wright himself questions. He admires
Mencken’s writing style, and realizes that words can be powerful tools. <em>A Book
of Prefaces</em> prompts Wright to wonder if he could ever communicate his ideas as
effectively.</p>

<h1 id="politics">Politics</h1>

<p>When he arrives in Chicago in 1927, Wright discovers revolutionary works that
advocate for the poor and oppressed, including Joseph Stalin’s <em>The National and
Colonial Question</em>. Wright communicates what value he found in Stalin’s work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stalin’s book showed how diverse minorities could be welded into unity, and I
regarded it as a most politically sensitive volume that revealed a new way of
looking upon lost and beaten peoples…I had read how these forgotten folk had
been encouraged to keep their old cultures, to see in their ancient customs
meanings and satisfactions as deep as those contained in supposedly superior
ways of living. (p. 335)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Stalin’s work, Wright sees the universality of injustice, and he empathizes
with the suffering of Russian peasants. The respect he shows for another group
of historically marginalized people mirrors the popular, 21st century
educational philosophies of culturally responsive and culturally sustaining
pedagogies.</p>

<p>Wright experiences novel emotions and convictions when he engages various genres
from around the world. In a life marked by deprivation, the intellectual wealth
Wright gains from literature sustains him.</p>
