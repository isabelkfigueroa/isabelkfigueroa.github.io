I"ù<p>British development economist Paul Collier draws attention to the needs of the
poorest billion people on earth in his 2007 book, <em>The Bottom Billion: Why the
Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It</em>. Professor Collier
outlines four traps that make it difficult for the poorest countries to escape
extreme poverty: <strong>conflict</strong>, <strong>natural resources</strong>, <strong>being landlocked with bad
neighbors</strong>, and <strong>bad governance</strong>. He explains that carefully integrated <strong>aid</strong>,
<strong>military intervention</strong>, <strong>laws and charters</strong>, and <strong>trade</strong> can combat economic
stagnancy.</p>

<h3 id="conflict-trap">Conflict Trap</h3>

<p>Conflict, in the form of civil war or a coup dâ€™Ã©tat, traps countries because
conflict tends to be repetitive. The loop is based on the reality that low
income and slow growth make a country prone to civil war and coups, which hinder
economic growth. Once violence breaks out, it is more likely to happen again in
the future.</p>

<p>Post-conflict areas benefit from aid in the form of basic services and
infrastructure. Military intervention, if the external military commits to about
a ten year presence, can help restore order and/or keep peace in the area. The
international community should also develop a charter for post conflict
situations so impartial norms (drawing from truth and reconciliation
experiences) can be referred to immediately.</p>

<h3 id="natural-resource-trap">Natural Resource Trap</h3>

<p>Natural resources, in the context of poverty, usually do not generate prosperity
for the people. The idea of Dutch disease suggests that natural resource exports
cause a countryâ€™s currency to become more valuable against foreign currencies.
The countryâ€™s other export activities then become uncompetitive. Natural
resource revenues can also be volatile, and increase the risk of civil war.
Professor Collier focuses on the negative effects natural resources have on
democracy. He argues that natural resource surpluses inflate the public sector,
corrupt election practices, and most importantly, weaken political restraints.</p>

<p>Citizens of countries that import natural resources can help put pressure on
resource-rich country leaders to adopt international transparency standards
regarding their natural resource industry (a natural resource charter). The
public should be aware of how resource extraction contracts are awarded, how
much money the government is making, and how the government is spending that
money.</p>

<h3 id="landlocked-with-bad-neighbors-trap">Landlocked with Bad Neighbors Trap</h3>

<p>Being landlocked with bad neighbors greatly affects a countryâ€™s ability to
trade. A landlocked country depends on its neighborsâ€™ roads and ports to engage
in international trade. If the landlocked country has coastal neighbors with
poor transportation infrastructure, exportation of primary and manufactured
products becomes expensive. A landlocked country could also trade with its
neighbors, but if neighboring countries are experiencing, for example,
government instability or violence, trade with the neighbors is also
problematic.</p>

<p>Professor Collier claims that in the 1990s, aid agencies began focusing more on
health, education, the environment, and country specific projects. The private
sector did not pick up the funding for roads from landlocked to coastal
countries. Roads would help. For countries of the Sahel close to Europe, air
freight could also be an option. With more education and information
infrastructure, the bottom billion could potentially break into global markets
with information services.</p>

<h3 id="bad-governance-trap">Bad Governance Trap</h3>

<p>Professor Collier argues against the long-time bottom billion strategy of trade
protection, and insists that low-income countries need the opportunity to trade
with richer countries. Protectionism doesnâ€™t work because the often tiny
domestic markets of the bottom billion can not support enough competition or
growth. Furthermore, high trade barriers allow firms to maintain monopolies and
inflate prices for consumers. Corrupt governments prosper because the
governments can simply protect businesses of their choice and profit off
imports.</p>

<p>Professor Collier believes that bad governance demands a charter for democracy,
defined not simply by elections, but how campaign money is raised and spent
before and election, and how power is checked and balanced after an election.
Professor Collier also trusts that once a country is truly committed to reform,
donors could begin to help by sending temporary, skilled workers (technical
assistance). OECD member countries must realize that trade policy negotiation
allows for policy incoherence. When OECD member countries subsidize the
production of crops in their own countries, and place higher tariffs on
processed materials than on unprocessed materials, they do not help bottom
billion countries. The OECD would be wise to develop trade policy that supports
export diversification and global opportunities for bottom billion countries.</p>
