I"º<p>In his work, <em>Development as Freedom</em> (1999), Dr. Amartya Sen discusses various freedoms that enable people to live their lives to the fullest. Dr. Sen, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics, views the expansion of individual freedoms, or capabilities, as both the means and ends of development. Thus, an understanding of development must go beyond economic growth and income-related variables. Dr. Sen highlights health care and education, democracy, and gender equality as freedoms that people have reason to enjoy, and that support a strong economy.</p>

<h3 id="health-care-and-education">Health Care and Education</h3>

<p>How can a poor country pay for health care and education? Dr. Sen explains that basic health care and education are highly labor intensive, and for a country in the early stages of economic development, labor costs are low. Furthermore, the state can provide health care and education in a way that is specific and non-transferable. Imagine a doctor decides that a patient needs a particular surgery. The patient may receive the surgery, not fungible money from the state. The direct delivery of a social support based on an observable need reduces waste and abuse of the system.</p>

<p>Shouldn‚Äôt people be responsible for themselves? Dr. Sen explains that personal responsibility is of course necessary, but individuals first require the opportunity to exercise their responsibility. A child that is never taught to read and write, or does not receive the treatment he needs for a curable disease, is denied opportunities that an educated, healthy person exercises. Social support that helps individuals achieve a foundational level of freedom also cultivates a society with more responsible community members.</p>

<p>Dr. Sen rejects the notion that economic development must precede a state‚Äôs provision of basic health care and education. Japan expanded education and later health care before achieving significant economic development. In the mid-nineteenth century, pre-industrialized Japan enjoyed a higher literacy rate than Europe at that time, despite Europe‚Äôs decades of industrialization. Not only can the expansion of education and health care come before economic growth, but the investment in human resources can spur the economy. Literate, numerate, and healthy people are better able to contribute to economic growth.</p>

<h3 id="democracy">Democracy</h3>

<p>During difficult times, the absence of democracy may become especially devastating. Consider an economic downturn that creates conditions where families cannot afford to buy food. In an undemocratic country, people have no effective means of communicating their needs to the top. Even with accurate information, an undemocratic government is less pressured to respond. People in Ireland, India, China, and Ethiopia, were devastated by famines largely because their political subjugation prevented them from receiving the timely economic relief they needed from their governments.</p>

<p>The British Empire considered Irish and Indian subjects inherently inferior and undeserving of political influence. The great difference in power between British rulers and disenfranchised groups of the British Empire allowed for the Great Famine (1845-1849) in Ireland and the Bengal famine of 1943 in India. The Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong, enforced top-down policies on the Chinese people, but provided no effective channels for information to flow the other way. The Communist Party‚Äôs lack of information and consequent inaction allowed the Great Chinese Famine from 1959-1961. In Ethiopia, military dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam also remained politically immune from the suffering of the Ethiopian people during the famine of 1983-1985.</p>

<p>Dr. Sen explains that a crisis such as famine is unlikely in an independent country with a functioning, multiparty democratic government. In a democratic environment, people have the ability to communicate their needs to the government. Furthermore, the government is incentivized to respond to the public‚Äôs demands because the government depends on public support. A free press, political opposition groups, and elections keep the public informed and powerful, and the government informed and responsive.</p>

<h3 id="gender-equality">Gender Equality</h3>

<p>In parts of Asia and North Africa, men tend to outnumber women. Dr. Sen points out that the male to female ratios in some Asian and North African countries are unlike the ratios in most of Europe, North America, and sub-Saharan Africa. He attributes the higher female mortality rate in Asia and North Africa to the neglect of female health and nutrition. Dr. Sen‚Äôs 1992 article, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/GenderInequalityMissingWomen.pdf" target="_blank">Missing Women</a>,‚Äù which appeared in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, suggests that if Asia and North Africa reflected the same male to female ratios as Europe, North America, or sub-Saharan Africa, there would be tens of millions more women in the world. Dr. Sen cites sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, primarily the neglect of female health during childhood, and maternal mortality as reasons why mortality rates are higher for women at every stage of life in parts of Asia and North Africa.</p>

<p>Dr. Sen argues that anti-female bias erodes when women are educated and employed.
When women are perceived as capable of more than child bearing and rearing, they wield more influence on their families and communities. On the family level, educated women are more likely to have children that survive, and have fewer children.</p>

<p>In the community, one way for women to exercise their free choice is through their employment. The <a href="http://www.grameen.com/" target="_blank">Grameen Bank</a>, founded by Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, makes a special effort to provide microcredit to women borrowers. While women and men should be able to gain employment outside the home, both men and women should be able share unpaid work in the home. Women should not be double burdened by their work outside the home and their completion of all of the housework.</p>
