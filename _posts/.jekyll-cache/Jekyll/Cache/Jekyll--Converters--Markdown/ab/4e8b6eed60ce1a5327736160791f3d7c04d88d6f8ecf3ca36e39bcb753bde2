I"` <p>In J.K. Rowling’s, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em> (1997), Harry Potter’s life changes when he meets Rubeus Hagrid. The Dursleys, Petunia, Vernon, and Dudley, disparage Harry’s deceased parents, his schooling, and general well-being. In stark contrast, Hagrid shows Harry that he truly values Harry’s mother and father, education, and his emotional health. More transformative for Harry’s life than the discovery of magic, is Hagrid’s caring friendship.</p>

<h3 id="harrys-parents">Harry’s Parents</h3>

<p>Harry’s Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon are never positive about Harry’s parents, Lily and James Potter. The Dursleys reveal no evidence of Harry’s parents in their conversations or in their home: “[Harry] couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house” (p. 31). The Dursleys never offer Harry any information about his parents, and they also don’t allow Harry to ask about them. Without any words or images of them in the home, Harry has no understanding of his parents. When the Dursleys do finally mention Lily and James, the Dursleys speak horribly about them. Petunia says of Harry’s mother, “I was the only one who saw her for what she was - a freak!” (p. 57). Petunia, a non-magic person, condemns her sister Lily’s gift of witchcraft, which she considers abnormal. Vernon tells Harry, “…as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion…” (p. 61). Vernon not only deems Harry’s parents misfits, he goes so far as to say that he feels content that Lily and James are dead. The Dursleys either try to ignore or discredit Harry’s parents.</p>

<p>Hagrid begins to tell Harry about his parents the very night he arrives with Harry’s invitation to Hogwarts. Hagrid says to Harry: “…yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head Boy an’ Girl at Hogwarts in their day!” (p. 59). Hagrid speaks highly of the Potters’ witchcraft and wizardry. He also gives Harry specific information that might interest him; he tells Harry about his parents’ prestigious roles during their own school days. As Hagrid talks about Lily and James Potter, he begins to cry. He says to Harry, “Sorry…but it’s that sad - knew yer mum and dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find…” (pp. 59-60). Hagrid praises Harry’s parents for their kindness, and sincerely mourns their deaths. For Christmas that year, Hagrid gives Harry a photo album, full of photos of Harry’s parents from friends of theirs: “It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book…It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father” (p. 327). Hagrid makes the effort to collect photos from different people so Harry can have a glimpse at his parents’ happy times. Hagrid respects Lily and James for their magic and kindness, he expresses sorrow for their deaths, and tries to help Harry maintain a positive memory of them.</p>

<h3 id="harrys-education">Harry’s Education</h3>

<p>Petunia and Vernon make it clear that they have no interest in Harry’s learning, especially in comparison to the great care they put into their own son’s education. For secondary school, they decide to send their son, Dudley, to Vernon’s alma mater, Smeltings, and they buy Dudley a smart new uniform in London. The Dursleys decide to send Harry to a local secondary school, Stonewall High (p. 63). Harry also requires a uniform but Petunia does not buy Harry new clothes. Instead, Petunia dyes some of Dudley’s old clothes to serve as Harry’s uniform: “There was a horrible smell in the kitchen…full of what looked like dirty rags…Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform” (p. 35). While they are happy to spend money on Dudley’s education and school uniform, Petunia and Vernon choose not to invest in Harry in the same way. None of the Dursleys care about Harry’s experience in school.</p>

<p>Unlike the Dursleys, Hagrid wants the best educational experience for Harry. Hagrid tells Harry and the Dursleys, “[Harry’s] off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world…an’ he’ll be under the greatest Headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus [Dumbledore]” (p. 63). Hagrid trusts that Hogwarts is the finest school, and he believes that the school has the best possible leader. Hagrid takes Harry school shopping, and spends his own money to buy Harry’s customary school pet. Hagrid says to Harry, “…I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at…I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer post an’ everything” (p. 87). Hagrid understands that Harry is unfamiliar with the wizarding world, so he thinks carefully about what kind of pet is best for Harry. Hagrid chooses an owl because he cares that Harry has a modern and useful pet. He wants Harry to be well-prepared for his illustrius new school.</p>

<h3 id="harrys-well-being">Harry’s Well-Being</h3>

<p>The Dursleys exclude Harry every way they can. For example, “Every year on Dudley’s birthday his parents took [Dudley] and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger bars or the cinema. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg…Harry hated it there” (p. 23). The family excludes Harry from celebrations, which denies him socialization, activity, and special meals. The Dursleys also physically segregate Harry in the home. They force him to sleep in a closet rather than a bedroom like the rest of the family: “Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that’s where he slept” (p. 20). The small storage area that is Harry’s room serves as a daily reminder that he is not welcome in the Dursleys’ home. Although under the same roof, the Dursleys force Harry to live an isolated life.</p>

<p>Hagrid celebrates special occasions with Harry, and welcomes him into his home immediately. First, Hagrid comes to tell Harry about Hogwarts on Harry’s eleventh birthday. The Dursleys make no mention of Harry’s birthday, but Hagrid immediately says to Harry, “‘a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here…’ Inside [the box] was a large, sticky chocolate cake with <em>Happy Birthday Harry</em> written on it in green icing” (pp. 51-52). Hagrid remembers Harry’s birthday and brings him a personalized birthday cake to celebrate. After Harry’s first week at Hogwarts, Hagrid invites Harry to visit him in his home on campus. He sends Harry a message that reads, “Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week” (p. 145). Hagrid takes the time to empathize with Harry - he knows Harry is at a new school with all new people. Unlike the Dursleys, Hagrid tries to make Harry feel welcome in his home, and offers to spend time with him over food and drink. Hagrid expresses an interest in Harry’s life and encourages Harry to share what is on his mind.</p>

<p>Magic certainly delights Harry, but it is Harry’s first friend in the wizarding world, Rubeus Hagrid, who truly changes Harry’s life. In the muggle world, Harry has only the Dursleys. Regarding Harry’s parents, the Durselys are either silent or cruel. When Harry meets Hagrid, he finally hears the truth about his wonderful parents for the first time in his life. In the muggle world, the Dursleys refuse to even decently clothe Harry for school. Hagrid shows tremendous admiration for Hogwarts and accompanies Harry to secure all the best school supplies. Most terrible of all, the Dursleys isolate Harry from their family. Hagrid extends Harry the warmth and care that all children deserve. After a lifetime with the Dursleys, Hagrid changes Harry’s life with friendship.</p>
