The six main organs of the United Nations (UN) are: The General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, International Court of
Justice, and Secretariat. While UN Headquarters in New York City host much of the activity, the International Court of Justice convenes at The Hague in the Netherlands.

# [General Assembly](https://www.un.org/en/ga/)

The General Assembly can initiate studies, host discussions, and make
recommendations for the well-being of Member States. The General Assembly
consists of representatives from each of the [UN’s 193 Member
States](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states).

# [Security Council](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/)

The Security Council focuses on the maintenance and restoration of peace around
the world. The Security Council includes 15 of the UN Member States. The five
Members that have permanent representation on the Security Council are: Russia,
China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The General Assembly
elects the remaining ten Members.

# [Economic and Social Council](https://www.un.org/ecosoc/en/)

The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) implements the UN’s economic, social,
environmental, and development goals. The General Assembly elects 54 Members to
serve on the ECOSOC.

# [Trusteeship Council](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/trusteeship-council)

The Trusteeship Council supervised [11 Trust
Territories](https://research.un.org/en/docs/tc/territories) - seven in Africa
and four in Oceania - after the Second World War. In 1994, the Trusteeship
Council suspended its activity. The Trusteeship Council no longer administers
any territories.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) settles legal disputes that Member
States submit, and also provides legal opinions to the United Nations and its
agencies. The ICJ is the judicial body of the United Nations, and the highest
international court. The 15 judges on the Court deliberate at the Peace Palace in
The Hague.
