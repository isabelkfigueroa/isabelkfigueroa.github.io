Teachers use assessments as a way to gain and share information. Dr. Carol Ann
Tomlinson and Dr. Tonya R. Moon's _Assessment and
Student Success in a Differentiated Classroom_ (2013), explains the significance of assessments at
various stages of student learning. Teachers assess students before, during,
and after any unit of study through the use of pre-assessments, ongoing
assessments, and summative assessments, respectively.

# Pre-Assessment

Teachers use pre-assessments, or diagnostic assessments, to get a better
understanding of their students’ **prior knowledge**, **personal
interests**, and **learning preferences** or needs.

When teachers determine what students think they know about an upcoming unit,
teachers are able to see any gaps or misconceptions students may have. A
pre-assessment that calls for students to share their prior knowledge helps
teachers know where to begin with instruction.

Teachers assess student interests so they can help students incorporate their
interests into their studies. Learning experiences are most meaningful when students personalize their assignments in some ways.

Finally, pre-assessments can help students decide what resources they want to
use, and what kind of product they want to create. When students have access to a topic through texts, videos, and other media, they are more likely to find resources that resonate with them.

# Ongoing Assessment

Teachers use ongoing assessments throughout a unit of study to monitor student
progress. The data teachers obtain from the assessments helps them make informed
decisions about how to proceed with instruction.

Teachers provide supportive, specific, timely feedback on the assessments so
that students can also move forward effectively. With teacher feedback, students
become aware of their strengths, and areas where they can improve. Ongoing assessments
are opportunities for students to _practice_.

# Summative Assessment

Teachers grade summative assessments at the end of a unit of study, after
students practice and receive feedback.
A graded summative assessment communicates a student’s academic
achievement regarding the learning objectives. Teachers should be sure that the
assessment requirements reflect the initial goals of the unit, and the students' practice work. Students should know what to expect in advance, and
should not be surprised by any element of the assessment.

Summative assessments are effective when they are as free of **error**,
**teacher bias**, and **“grade fog**” as possible. Teachers decrease error when they include clear directions and questions on the summative assessment, and when
students have enough time to finish the assessment.

Teachers minimize teacher bias when they grade according to a rubric. Students, teachers, and parents should be able to see how the student’s
work compares to the clear criteria of the assessment.

Teachers diminish grade fog when the assessment grade exclusively reflects the student’s academic achievement. For example, extra credit, bonus points, or a curve, shouldn't raise a summative grade, and messy handwriting shouldn't lower a summative grade.

As Doctors Tomlinson and Moon explain, assessments come in various forms and at various times, but all effective assessments should communicate meaningful information.
